PHANTASMAGORIA&CANTO I&"The Trystyng"
One&winter night,&at half-past nine,
Cold, tired,&and cross,&and muddy,
I had come home,&too late&to dine,
And supper,&with cigars&and wine,
Was&waiting&in the study.
There was&a strangeness&in the room,
And&Something&white and wavy
Was standing&near me&in the gloom -
I took it&for the&carpet-broom
Left by&that careless&slavey.
But presently&the Thing&began
To shiver&and&to sneeze:
On which&I said&"Come, come, my man!
That's a most&inconsiderate&plan.
Less&noise there,&if you please!"
"I've caught a cold,"&the Thing&replies,
"Out there&upon the&landing."
I turned&to look&in some surprise,
And there,&before&my very eyes,
A little&Ghost&was standing!
